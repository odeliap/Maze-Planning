# Create2 Maze-Planning and Execution

This repository contains the code for maze planning and execution for the roomba Create2.

We used pyhop for the maze planning aspect of this project and Create2 to connect to the roomba 
and have it follow the maze-generated steps to successfully navigate its way through the maze.
